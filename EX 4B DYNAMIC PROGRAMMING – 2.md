## DATE:
## AIM:
To find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two strings..



## Algorithm
1. Initialize a 2D table (lookup) of size (m+1) x (n+1) with all values set to 0, where m and n are the lengths of strings X and Y.

2. Set maxLength = 0 and endingIndex = m to keep track of the longest match found and where it ends in X.

3. Iterate through both strings: for each X[i-1] and Y[j-1], if they match, set lookup[i][j] = lookup[i-1][j-1] + 1.

4. Update maxLength and endingIndex whenever a longer match is found.

5. Return the substring of X from endingIndex - maxLength to endingIndex as the longest common substring.

                lookup[i][j] = lookup[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
 
                if lookup[i][j] > maxLength:
                    maxLength = lookup[i][j]
                    endingIndex = i
 
    return X[endingIndex - maxLength: endingIndex]

    X = input()
    Y = input()
 
    m = len(X)
